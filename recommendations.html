			<h2>Succulents</h2>
			<p>If you live in a state like California or any part of the world that is prone to a drought, succulents are plants that don't require a lot of water. The majority of succulents are drought-resistent and don't need much water to survive. One succulent I recommend is Crassula Ovata or the Jade plant. The Jade plant doesn't take much to grow. Much like other succulents, it requires very little water. It also has the ability to grow from a branch. Take a small branch of the Jade plant and it can grow as large as you let it. As long as there room, the Jade plant will continue to grow and sprout more branches from itself. Personally speaking, its leaves are also very beautiful.</p>
			<p>Even if you don't live in a place that is particularly hot or drought-prone, I still recommend succulents. They can be great beginner plants that can survive if you forget to water it. Just make sure to grow them indoors if you live in an area that reach temperatures below 30 Fahrenheit.</p>

			<h2>Nopal or Opuntia cacti</h2>
			<p>For the same reasons as succulents, I recommend cacti for a beginner plant. The only difference between both succulents and cacti is that cacti don't typically grow leaves or petals. There is one specific cacti that I specifically recommend however. The Nopal, derived from the Nahuatl word 'nohpalli', or the Obuntia cacti is a great plant to grow in your yard. They can grow very easily much like succulents. They can grow in hot and dry areas as many cacti can. The best part is that the pads can be edible and have medicinal usage as well. The prickly pear fruit that it grows can also be prepared to be eaten. The downsides of growing nopal is that you might struggle growing it in colder regions and harvesting it can be a pain with the thorns getting stuck to you. Aside from that, nopal is a great plant to grow as a beginner.</p>

			<h2>Why I took up gardening</h2>
			<p>During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I found myself looking for things to do to pass the time. I decided to take up gardening. It was a reason for me to go outside and keep myself busy with something. I found myself enjoying caring for plants and watching them grow from small seeds. I enjoyed looking at how beautiful and vibrant the plants become. It was like a natural work of art. Gardening became a very fulfilling activity to engage in and I want to share my love for it.</p>

			<h2>The utility of becoming an amateur botanist</h2>
			<p>Taking up gardening can come with many useful skills. Learning to grow your own plants will teach you what it takes to make it grow into something vibrant and healthy. This can lead you to grow your own food. You can learn to locally grow your own organic produce which can be useful in a number of scenarios. Maybe you're trying to eat food as organically as possible. It can also be useful to know how to grow your own food if there's a time of crisis when purchasing produce isn't an option. This is one of many useful skills you learn when becoming a gardener.</p>
			<p>Another useful skill is being able to somewhat identify plants when you're out in nature. Growing many different plants can give you an idea of what certain plants are and what they can do. Maybe you're out on a hike and see you a plant that might harm you if you touch it. You can also become a bit of an amateur forager if you learn how to identify plants by becoming a gardener.</p>
